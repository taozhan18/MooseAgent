      "Assistant: To define a Dirichlet boundary condition in MOOSE, you typically use the `DirichletBC` class. This class is used to enforce a fixed value (usually zero) on a specified boundary for a given variable. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to define a Dirichlet boundary condition in a MOOSE input file:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Define the Variable:**\n",
      "   First, you need to define the variable on which you want to apply the Dirichlet boundary condition. This is usually done in the `Variables` block of the input file.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```yaml\n",
      "   [Variables]\n",
      "     [u]\n",
      "       order = FIRST\n",
      "       family = LAGRANGE\n",
      "     []\n",
      "   []\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Define the Boundary Condition:**\n",
      "   Next, you define the Dirichlet boundary condition in the `Kernels` block. You specify the variable, the boundary where the condition should be applied, and the value to be enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```yaml\n",
      "   [BCs]\n",
      "     [left]\n",
      "       type = DirichletBC\n",
      "       variable = u\n",
      "       boundary = left\n",
      "       value = 0\n",
      "     []\n",
      "   []\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   - `type`: Specifies the type of boundary condition, which is `DirichletBC` in this case.\n",
      "   - `variable`: The variable to which the boundary condition is applied.\n",
      "   - `boundary`: The boundary where the condition is enforced. This can be a single boundary or a list of boundaries.\n",
      "   - `value`: The value to be enforced on the boundary. This is usually zero but can be any constant or even a function.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Define the Mesh and Boundaries:**\n",
      "   Ensure that your mesh has the boundaries defined where you want to apply the Dirichlet boundary condition. This is typically done in the `Mesh` block.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```yaml\n",
      "   [Mesh]\n",
      "     type = GeneratedMesh\n",
      "     dim = 2\n",
      "     nx = 10\n",

      "     ymin = 0\n",
      "     ymax = 1\n",
      "   []\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   In this example, the boundaries `left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `top` are automatically generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Run the Simulation:**\n",
      "   Once everything is set up, you can run the simulation using the MOOSE executable.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Input File:\n",

      "### Additional Notes:\n",
      "- **Multiple Boundaries:** You can apply the same boundary condition to multiple boundaries by specifying a list of boundaries in the `boundary` parameter.\n",
      "- **Non-zero Values:** If you want to enforce a non-zero value, you can simply change the `value` parameter.\n",
      "- **Function Values:** If you want to enforce a spatially or temporally varying value, you can use a `Function` object and specify it in the `value` parameter.\n",
