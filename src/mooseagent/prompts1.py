The following are the user's simulation requirements:

Here is the feedback from the user (if any):
<feedback>
{feedback}

You first need to determine how many input files need to be built to complete the simulation task (one is sufficient for most problems, but multi-physics coupling problems usually require multiple), and determine the name (including suffixes) of each input file, as well as the purpose of each input file. For each input file, you need to provide a detailed description. It is especially important to clearly specify in the description if there are the same physical quantities between different files to ensure consistency. If it is an .i file, it usually needs to include geometric shapes, physical processes, boundary conditions, solution settings, etc., as follows:
-Geometry/Mesh: Clarify the geometric features such as shape and structure of the simulated object. Provide specific and quantitative grid partitioning methods to determine the dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D) and coordinate systems (RZ, Cartesian, etc.) of the problem.
-Physical Process: Describing the physical phenomena and principles involved in simulation, such as mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, etc.
-Boundary conditions: describe the boundary conditions on the boundary of the simulation area, such as the action of forces, temperature distribution, and the type of boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, etc.)
-Material: Describe the material properties of the simulated object that need to be used in the simulation, such as density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc.
-Solution setting: Determine the solution method, time step, convergence criteria, etc. used in the simulation.
Finally, prompt the user to confirm whether the simulation description meets their requirements.
-Post processing (if any): Describe the post-processing methods and results of the simulation, such as the distribution of temperature, stress, displacement, etc.
You should reply a list:
<write the number of files> needed to complete the simulation task.
File_name: Write the file name.
Description: Write the detailed description of the file.
...
File_name: Write the file name.
Description: Write the detailed description of the file.

Each sub-task should complete different modules,
Please ensure that the variable names of the same physical quantity in all modules are consistent, so please specify clearly in the description of each sub-task.
You should also determine whether to retrieve information from the database. For simple modules such as defining variables, queries are usually not required. But for complex modules like Kernels, you'd better do retrieval to ensure accuracy.
