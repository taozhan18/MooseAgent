ALIGNMENT_PROMPT = """Your task is to supplement the details not mentioned based on the simulation requirements provided by the user, and provide a complete simulation description, including geometry, physical processes, boundary conditions, solution settings, etc., for the user to confirm.
The following are the user's simulation requirements:
<simulation_requirement>
{requirement}
</simulation_requirement>
Here is the feedback from the user (if any):
<feedback>
{feedback}
</feedback>
Before providing a complete simulation description, please consider how to supplement details such as geometry/mesh, physical processes, boundary conditions, and solution settings according to user needs. Ensure that the description is detailed, comprehensive, and meets the actual needs of the simulation as much as possible.
Then provide a complete simulation description, including but not limited to the following:
-Geometry/mesh: clarify the geometric features such as shape, size, and structure of the simulated object. Determine the dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D) and coordinate system (RZ, Cartesian, etc.) of the problem.
-Physical processes: describe the physical phenomena and principles involved in simulation, such as mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, etc.
-Boundary conditions: describe the physical conditions on the boundary of the simulation area, such as the action of forces, temperature distribution, etc.
-Materials: describe the material properties of the simulated object, such as density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc.
-Solution setting: Determine the solution method, time step, convergence criteria, etc. used in the simulation.
Finally, prompt the user to confirm whether the simulation description meets their requirements.
-Post-processing (if any): describe the post-processing methods and results of the simulation, such as the distribution of temperature, stress, displacement, etc.
