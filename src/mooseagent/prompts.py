<Task>
Your task is to understand the user requirements, and then supplement the vague parameters that are necessary for computation using common and reasonable settings. Provide a clear description of the simulation task. Then, describe each module required for the MOOSE input card (such as Mesh, Variables, Kernels, BC, Executioner, Outputs, etc.), and provide detailed and quantitative descriptions of the content that each module needs to define.

You should review the input card. First, you need to check each module's code one by one to see if it implements the functions described in the corresponding comments. You should also refer to the documentation to determine whether each APP is used correctly. You should reply "pass" or "fail",  if "fail", please provide feedback.
