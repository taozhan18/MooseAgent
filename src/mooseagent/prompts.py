HUMAN_ALIGNMENT_PROMPT = """
The following are the user's simulation requirements:
<simulation_requirement>
{requirement}
</simulation_requirement>
Here is the feedback from the user (if any):
<feedback>
{feedback}
</feedback>
You first need to determine how many input files need to be built to complete the simulation task (one is sufficient for most problems, but multi-physics coupling problems usually require multiple), and determine the name (including suffixes) of each input file, as well as the purpose of each input file. For each input file, you need to provide a detailed description. It is especially important to clearly specify in the description if there are the same physical quantities between different files to ensure consistency. If it is an .i file, it usually needs to include geometric shapes, physical processes, boundary conditions, solution settings, etc., as follows:
-Geometry/Mesh: Clarify the geometric features such as shape and structure of the simulated object. Provide specific and quantitative grid partitioning methods to determine the dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D) and coordinate systems (RZ, Cartesian, etc.) of the problem.
-Physical Process: Describing the physical phenomena and principles involved in simulation, such as mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, etc.
-Boundary conditions: describe the boundary conditions on the boundary of the simulation area, such as the action of forces, temperature distribution, and the type of boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, etc.)
-Material: Describe the material properties of the simulated object that need to be used in the simulation, such as density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc.
-Solution setting: Determine the solution method, time step, convergence criteria, etc. used in the simulation.
Finally, prompt the user to confirm whether the simulation description meets their requirements.
-Post processing (if any): Describe the post-processing methods and results of the simulation, such as the distribution of temperature, stress, displacement, etc.
You should reply a like this:
<write the number of files> needed to complete the simulation task.
File_name1: Write the file name.
Description: Write the detailed description of the file.
File_name2: Write the file name.
Description: Write the detailed description of the file.

SYSTEM_ARCHITECT_PROMPT = """Please create a MOOSE input file structure based on the user's requirements and output an input file with detailed comments. Typically, a MOOSE input file consists of the following core modules: Mesh, Variables, Kernels, BCs, Executor, and Outputs. In addition, there are several optional modules available for selection, such as Global Parameters, Materials, Auxiliary Variables, Auxiliary Kernels, Integrated Circuits, Transfers, Functions, MultiApps, Preprocessing, etc. When creating the input file, please avoid introducing modules or applications that do not exist in the MOOSE framework.
Before starting to create the input file, please carefully read the specific urequirements of the simulation task below:
<Simulation Task Requirements>
{requirements}
</Simulation Task Requirements>
In addition, to better complete the task, please carefully review the following relevant MOOSE simulation examples, and refer to their content as much as possible:
