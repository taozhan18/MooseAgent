{feedback}

Please perform the following tasks:

1. Understand the user requirements, and then supplement the vague parameters that are necessary for computation using common and reasonable settings, finally provide a more complete and specific simulation requirement.
2. Extract and structure the following information:
   Necessary information:
   - Mesh: dimension, coordinate system, Geometric, etc.
   - Physical variables: temperature, stress, velocity, etc.
   - Physical equation: steady-state/transient(time derivative), heat/mechanics, etc.
   - Boundary Conditions: locations and specific conditions (Neumann/Dirichlet/etc.).
   - Materials: List the material parameters to be defined (e.g., elastic modulus, thermal conductivity).
   - Executioner: time step, time step type, solver type, preconditioner, etc.
   - ...  (other settings that are necessary for computation).

3. Develop specific knowledge retrieval subtasks based on structured requirements (clearly listed). Please note that MOOSE documentation only describes general functionalities, usage instructions, parameters, and capabilities of the application (APP). Ensure that the search is easy to find. For example: Function created by parsing a expression string; Riemann boundary conditions with a function; How to add a body force item in equation?
