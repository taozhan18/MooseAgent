"Your task is to supplement the details not mentioned based on the simulation requirements provided by the user, and provide a complete simulation description, including geometry, physical processes, boundary conditions, solution settings, etc., for the user to confirm.\nThe following are the user's simulation requirements:\n<simulation_requirement>\n\n    Perform steady-state thermomechanical calculations for a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel rod. The setup is as follows:\n    Geometric Conditions: The fuel pellet is made of UO₂ ceramic with a diameter of 8.192 mm; The cladding is made of Zr4 alloy with an inner diameter of 8.36 mm, an outer diameter of 9.5 mm, and a height of 3657 mm.\n    Boundary Conditions: Adiabatic boundary conditions are applied at the top and bottom; The right side is set as an isothermal boundary condition, with an inlet temperature of 293 K and an outlet temperature of 333 K. The temperature in between is linearly interpolated; The gap between the fuel pellet and the cladding is set with an internal pressure of 2 MPa.\n    Source Term: The volume heat generation rate in the fuel pellet is set as a cosine distribution along the axial direction and is uniform in the radial direction; The power is 0 at the top and bottom, and reaches a maximum of 2×10⁷ kW/m³ at the center.\n    Material Properties: Fuel Pellet Thermal Conductivity: 1/(11.8+0.0238*T) + 8.775*1e-13*T^3 W/(cm·°C), Fuel Pellet Thermal Expansion Coefficient: Isotropic, with the formula: 7.107e-6+5.16e-9*T+3.42e-13*T^2(°C^(-1)); Cladding Thermal Conductivity: 0.15W/(cm·°C); Cladding Thermal Expansion Coefficient: 5.5e-6(°C^(-1)). In all formulas, T represents temperature in °C.\n    \n</simulation_requirement>\nHere is the feedback from the user (if any):\n<feedback>\n\n</feedback>\nBefore providing a complete simulation description, please consider how to supplement details such as geometry/mesh, physical processes, boundary conditions, and solution settings according to user needs. Ensure that the description is detailed, comprehensive, and meets the actual needs of the simulation as much as possible.\nThen provide a complete simulation description, including but not limited to the following:\n-Geometry/mesh: Clarify the geometric features such as shape, size, and structure of the simulated object.\n-Physical processes: describe the physical phenomena and principles involved in simulation, such as mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, etc.\n-Boundary conditions: describe the physical conditions on the boundary of the simulation area, such as the action of forces, temperature distribution, electric field strength, etc.\n-Materials: describe the material properties of the simulated object, such as density, elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, etc.\n-Solution setting: Determine the solution method, time step, convergence criteria, etc. used in the simulation.\nFinally, prompt the user to confirm whether the simulation description meets their requirements.\n\n<simulation_description>\n[Provide a complete simulation description here]\n</simulation_description>\nPlease confirm if the above simulation description meets your requirements."
