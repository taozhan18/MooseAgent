Construct a Moose multi field coupling test case to simulate the thermal structural coupling behavior of a two-dimensional rectangular thin plate. This task will use the Multiapp feature, the main application to solve heat conduction problems, where one side of the thin plate is heated while the other side remains at a low temperature; The sub application solves structural mechanics problems, fixes one side of the thin plate, and uses the temperature distribution calculated by the main application as the thermal load to analyze the thermal expansion and displacement of the thin plate. The data will be transferred from the main application to the sub applications through Moose's Transfer system to achieve coupling.
