Three-Dimensional Coupled Convection and Heat Transfer
Task Description:
A cubic cavity of side length 1 m is filled with fluid (dynamic viscosity μ = 0.001 Pa·s, density ρ = 1000 kg/m³, thermal conductivity k = 0.6 W/(m·K)). The left wall is maintained at 300 K, the right wall at 400 K, the top and bottom walls are adiabatic, and fluid enters from the bottom with a velocity of 0.01 m/s while exiting freely at the top. Perform a coupled flow and heat transfer simulation until a steady state is reached, then output velocity and temperature fields, as well as the temperature profile at the cavity’s center.
