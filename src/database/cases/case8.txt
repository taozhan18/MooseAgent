 Construct a Moose phase field simulation case to simulate the solidification process of pure metal in a two-dimensional rectangular region. This task will use a phase field model to simulate the transition of solid-liquid phase by solving the coupled evolution equation of phase field variables and temperature field. The boundary condition is to apply a low temperature below the solidification point on one side of the rectangular region to drive solidification, with the initial condition being that the metal is in a liquid state. The goal is to observe the formation and growth of solid phases, as well as the evolution and temperature distribution of solid-liquid interfaces.
