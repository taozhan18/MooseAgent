One-Dimensional Steady-State Heat Conduction
Task Description:
A metallic rod of length L = 1 m has its two ends kept at constant temperatures of 300 K and 350 K, respectively. The thermal conductivity (k) is 10 W/(mÂ·K). Under steady-state conditions, compute the temperature distribution along the rod and output the temperature profile as a function of position.
